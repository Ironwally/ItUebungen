A Simple Turtle Graphics Package
--------------------------------
(c) 2013 Carsten Sinz, KIT Karlsruhe

To compile:
    javac *.java

To run:
    java TurtleCanvas

The files in this directory are:
- Turtle.java:       implements a turtle with forward/left/right commands
- TurtleCanvas.java: some AWT/Swing stuff, the 'playground' of the turtle
- TurtlePath.java:   an interface with a 'draw' method to specify what the 
                     turtle should do
- {KochCurve,Snowflake,SquareArt,SimpleArt}.java: example implementations of the
                     'TurtlePath' interface

You can generate different drawings by implementing the 'TurtlePath'
interface. The path that the turtle takes has to be given in the 
constructor of 'TurtleCanvas'.

Three example implementations of 'TurtlePath' are given:
- KochCurve: draw a Koch curve
- Snowflake: draw a snowflake using Koch curves
- SquareArt: simple example drawing multiple squares
- SimpleArt: draw a square

Possible extensions:
- Paths in different colors
- Pen up/down command for the turtle
- Multiple turtles on one canvas
- ...
